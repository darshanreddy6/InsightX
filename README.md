## Installation
1. Clone the Repository
This step involves downloading the project files from the repository.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/darshhv/insightx.git
Replace yourusername with your actual GitHub username if this is a private or personal repository.
The git clone command will create a directory named insightx (same as the repository name) and download all project files.
Potential Issues:

Ensure Git is installed on your system. If not, download Git and install it.
If the repository is private, you’ll need authentication (GitHub credentials or SSH key).
2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Change to the newly cloned project directory.

bash
Copy code
cd insightx
This moves you into the root folder of the project, where all configuration and setup files are located.
Tips:

Use ls (Linux/Mac) or dir (Windows) to list files and ensure you're in the correct directory.
3. Install Dependencies
The dependencies are the external libraries and packages required to run the project.

bash
Copy code
[Add commands for your package manager, e.g., npm install, pip install -r requirements.txt, etc.]
